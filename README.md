# TODO
## The self-hosted ecosystem

While **TODO** sounds like the most generic todo list application, it's not just that.

We decided to start working on TODO to exercise our programming skills on an applicable use case.

### What TODO is about

- [x] Managing your todo list locally
- [x] Managing your todo list on a self-hosted WebAPI
- [ ] Managing your calendar events locally and through an API
- [ ] Real-time self-hosted chatting
